### Ternary Operator
`Conditional statement ? return value 1 : return value 2`
If the conditional statment is true, return value 1 if it is false, return value 2.

### Friend class
It can access to `private` and `protected member` to other `friend class`.

### Friend function
Same as `friend class`, it gives other to access `private` and `protected member` with function unit not as class unit.

### Static Variable
It can use as global variable in corresponding source code, and keep after scope is ended, plus it only initialized for once and keeps until program end. It has same scope as local variable but alive until program end as global variable. 

### Virtual
It used to declare function virtually in parent class, and it make child class declare in real. It used to manage modules as component, as modules have one same parent and make class as themselves with specify along their property.

### Template
It codes only `.h`s not `.cc`s.

# Forward Declarartions and Definitions

# Anonymous Namespace
