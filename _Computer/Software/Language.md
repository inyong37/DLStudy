## Verilog Hardware Description Language (Verilog HDL)
Verilog, standardized as IEEE 1364, is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. It is most commoly used in the design and verification of digital circuits at the register-transfer level of abstraction. It is also used in the verification of analog circuits and mixed-signal circuits, as well as in the design if genetic circuits.[2]

## [Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL)](http://www.eda-twiki.org/cgi-bin/view.cgi/P1076/WebHome)
Very High Speed Integrated Circuit Hardware Description Language (VHDL) is a hardware description language used in electronic design automation to describe digital and mixed-signal systems such as field-programmable gate arrays and integrated circuits. VHDL can also be used as a general-purpose parallel programming language.[4]
