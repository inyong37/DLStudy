# Framework

## [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow)
TensorFlow is an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning. It has a comprehensive, flexible ecosystem of tools, libraries, and community resources that lets researchs push the state-of-the-art in ML and developers easily build and deploy ML-powered applications.

TensorFlow was originally developed by researchers and engineers working on the Google Brain team within Google's Machine Intelligence Research organiztion to conduct machine learning and deep nural networks research. The system is general enough to be applicable in a wide variety of other domains, as well.

TensorFlow provides stable Python and C++ APIs, as well as non-guaranted backward compatible API for other languages. [Ref]

## [Keras](https://keras.io/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/keras-team/keras)
Keras is a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.

Multi-backend Keras has been discontinued. At this time, we recommend that Keras users who use multi-backend Keras with the TensorFlow backend switch to tf.keras in TensorFlow 2.0.

Keras 2.2.5 was the last release of Keras implementing the 2.2.* API. It was the last release to only support TensorFlow 1 (as well as Theano and CNTK).[Ref]

## [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/opencv/opencv)
Open Source Computer Vision Library[Ref]

(with CMake, cpp, h)

## [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch)
Tensors and Dynamic neural networks in Python with strong GPU acceleration[Ref]

(with submodule or bazel)

## [Caffe](https://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)
Caffe is a deep learning framework made with expression, speed, and modularity in mind. It is developed by Berkeley AI Research (BAIR) and by community contributors. Yangqing Jia created the project during his PhD at UC Berkeley. Caffe is released under the BSD 2-Clause license.[Ref]

(with CMake and docker)

## [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/Theano/Theano)
Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays efficiently. It can use GPUs and perform efficient symbolic differentiation.[Ref]

[MILA will stop developing Theano.](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/theano-users/7Poq8BZutbY/rNCIfvAEAwAJ)

## [CNTK](https://docs.microsoft.com/ko-kr/cognitive-toolkit/) | [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/CNTK)
The Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) is an open-source toolkit for commercial-grade distributed deep learning. It describes neural networks as a series of computational steps via a directed graph. CNTK allows the user to easily realize and combine popular model types such as feed-forward DNNs, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs/LSTMs). CNTK implements stochastic gradient descent (SGD, error backpropagation) learning with automatic differentiation and parallelization across multiple GPUs and servers.[Ref]
